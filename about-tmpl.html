<h1 class="about-text">My name is Cooper Swenson, I'm 24 years old and I have been fishing
  since I was 5. I'm originally from California so I grew up fishing for Large Mouth <span class="bass-class">Bass</span>. My older brother was a tournament Angler and
whenever he went fishing I always wanted to tag along. The older I got the more he let me come and the more I fell in love with fishing. I currently reside
in Utah and have had to adapt to not having a ton of lakes to fish for <span class="bass-class">bass</span> out here. I've been able to search maps and research out a few spots around
that produce some decent fish. On this website I will be discussing some of my favorite lures and methods of catching <span class="bass-class">bass</span>. Thanks for stopping by and feel free to
<a href="mailto:cooperswenson6@gmail.com" target="_newtab">email</a> me with any questions.
